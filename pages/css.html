        <h3>CSS Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language that turns your basic HTML webpage into the beautiful webscapes
            you see every day. CSS tells the HTML elements how they should be displayed on the screen.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            CSS was created by the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, in order to combat the nightmare of HTML styling. The 
            beauty of CSS is that it cn target multiple elements, even multiple pages, at once! This makes the process of styling
            a website much easier.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            CSS files can be stored in an HTML document, but it is good practice to keep your styling in a seperate .css file.
        </p>

        <h3>CSS Syntax</h3>
        <p>
            CSS has a few base elements for describing the style of a website: Selectors, declarations, properties, and values.
            There are a lot of properties that you can give your selections to make it look exactly how you want it to, so this
            guide won't go over them all. Check the <a href="learn-more.html">Learn More</a> page for links to resources that will
            have a more complete list of properties and values.
        </p>
        <h4>Selectors</h4>
        <table id="selector-table">
            <tr class="color-one">
                <th>Selectors</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr class="color-two">
                <td>tag</td>
                <td>
                    The tag selector is a common one, used for selecting non specific elements to style. Pick whichever html element you wish to style
                    (example: &lt;p&gt;) without the brackets. Then, put your properties and values in between curly braces, like so:
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    p { propety: value; }
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="color-one">
                <td>.class</td>
                <td>
                    The class selector is a little more specific. It is able to target any HTML element that has its class set to this selector.
                    To set the class in HTML simply type class="class_name" inside of your opening element, after the element declaration, like so: 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    &lt;p class="paragraph-one"&gt;
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    You target this selector the same way you do with a tag, excpet you put a period in front, indicating that it is a class.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="color-two">
                <td>#id</td>
                <td>
                    An ID is very similar to a class, however it is mainly used to target a single element that you wish to style differently.
                    Instead of leading the selection with a period, you use the pound sign, or hashtag (#). ID's are also declared inside of the
                    HTML document, just like the class, but say id="" instead of class="".
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="color-one">
                <td>*</td>
                <td>
                    The asterisk, or star, is a universal selector that targets EVERYTHING.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h4>Declarations, Properties, and Values</h4>
        <table id="dpv-table">
            <tr class="color-one">
                <th>Declaration</th>

                    A declaration is the full statement of property and value you assign to the element, class, or ID
                </td>
                <td>
                    A property is how you are wanting to style the element, class, or ID.
                </td>
                <td>
                    A value is the (duh) value you wish to give the element, class, or ID.
                </td>

                    "font-size" is the property.
                </td>
                <td>
                    "20px" is the value.

        <h3>The CSS Box Model</h3>
        <p>
            The box model describes the CSS and HTML concept where all elements are nested within boxes. There are four
            main boxes each and every HTML element is nested within that can be altered with CSS: The content, the padding
            around the content, the border around the padding, and the margin around the border.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following picture illustrates this:
