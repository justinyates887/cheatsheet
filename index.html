        <h3>Common HTML Tags</h3>
        <p>
            HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, has a variety of different tags available for you to use to build your very own website.
            The following table presents a list of some of the <strong>MOST COMMON</strong> HTML tags you will use and what they represent.
        </p>
        <table id="html-common-table">
            <tr class="color-one">
                <th>Tag</th>
                <th class="justify">Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr class="color-two">
                <td>&lt;h1-h6&gt;</td>
                <td>These tags are used for headings, 1 representing the largest and 6 representing the smallest.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="color-one">
                <td>&lt;p&gt;</td>
                <td>
                    These tags are used for paragraphs, or text contained on screen that is not imporant enough to 
                    be a heading.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="color-two">
                <td>&lt;a&gt;</td>
                <td>
                    This tag is used to link certain pages or URL's inside fo your code. &lt;a&gt; tags are always accompanied with
                    an href="link.example" inside of the opening tag to specify where you would like to go. Additionally, you can
                    modify the display text by putting text in between the opening and closing tag, like so: 
                    <br/><span class="italics">&lt;a href="link.example"&gt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">Click Here!</a>&lt;/a&gt;</span>
                    (Go ahead, click it).

                <td>
                    This tag is used to display an image on the webpage. Note that if you want an image to appear in the background, it is typically
                    better practice to add the image in css rather than in HTML.
                </td>
            </tr>

                <td>
                    A video tag allows you to embed a video directly into your webpage, either froma  local file or from an external link.
                    HTML has built in properties to allow you to customize the height, width, and have standard playback tools (controls).
                    Most video tags must also nest a &lt;source&gt; tag with the src="video.mp4" attribute defined.

                    A link tag is used in the header of your document, not to be confused with the &lt;a&gt; tag. This tag typically links your
                    CSS stylesheet to your HTML document.

            <h3>Important HTML Tags</h3>
            <p>
                Every HTML document will have certain tags, no matter the content of the webpage. While some of the tags listen next will not necissarily
                be used in every HTML document, it is important to know them as they will be very common.

                      <td>
                          This tag is a <strong>MUST</strong> on every HTML document. It tells the browser to expect an HTML document
                          and allows it to render the code properly. This tag will be the first thing at the top of your HTML code.
                      </td>

                        Immidiately following the doctype tag, this is another <strong>MUST</strong>. All of your HTML code should be 
                        nested within this tag.

                        the author, the desciprtion, and the title. This is where your &lt;link&gt; tag will be nested as well (containing your 
                        stylesheet). None of this information will display on your actual webpage (The title will show on the tab of your broswer if supported).

                        This beloved tag is what is known as a comment tag. When used inside of an HTML document it is a way to add text
                        into the file without it trying to render. This is very useful for describing what you are doing or leaving notes in 
                        the code.

            <h3>Interactive HTML Tags</h3>
            <p>
                Many websites contain interactive elements, such as forms and buttons, that take and store user input. You might think there 
                is complex code at work, and sometimes you may be right, but just like everything else HTML lays the framework for these items.
                In the table below are a few HTML tags that allow you to customize and recieve user input.
            </p>
            <table id="html-interactive-table">
                <tr class="color-one">

                    <td>
                        Forms are a way of giving your user selections to choose from. There are a lot of different ways to recieve input with forms.

                    <td>
                        Used in accordance with forms (typically) the input tag allows you to declare what type of input you would like to receive from
                        the user. See the link above for a complete list of input types.

                        Output is where you would display the reult of the information you requested, if any. A good exaample would be a calculator: 
                        Input takes the equation, output displays the result!
